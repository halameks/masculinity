## Masculinity Survey
#### Ideas about masculinity

This dataset contains the results of a survey asking adults who identify as men to reflect on their ideas about masculinity. The survey was conducted by SurveyMokey in partnership with FiveThirtyEight and WNYC Studios from May 10-22, 2018. It was used in the story https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-do-men-think-it-means-to-be-a-man/. 

View the original survey here: https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/blob/master/masculinity-survey/masculinity-survey.pdf

raw-responses.csv contains all 1,615 responses. The survey included 4 types of questions: single choice- single answer, multiple choice- single answer, multiple choice- multiple answer, and open ended/ free text. Open end questions were omitted from the response data set. None of the questions were required, so respondents could skip any of the questions. If a respondent skipped a question, it was recorded as 'No answer' **(not Null/ NAN)**. 

I was interested in using the demographic data of the respondents, plus their responses to questions about insecurities and frequency of emotional behaviors to predict self-reported sense of masculinity.
